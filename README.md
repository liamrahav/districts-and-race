### How to install mandeR

`mandeR` is needed to produce the Convex Hull compactness scores for districts used in the project. To install mandeR, first make sure you have installed R. Then edit the `install_mandeR.R` script to correctly reflect the directory in which you have cloned this repository. Run the script, and you should then be able to run `dataset/score_shapefiles.R` to augment the shapefiles with their Convex Hull scores yourself.
